            <p class="txt-desc">Some states have taken tentative steps toward reopening businesses shuttered by the
                coronavirus. In Georgia, it meant a few residents were out getting haircuts and their tongues pierced.

                <p class="txt-content">Riley Crutchfield, a hairdresser in Macon, Georgia, is nervous about going back
                    to a job that
                    requires her to touch people all day. In Houston, former Waffle House trainee manager Maxime Pierre
                    has election-year politics and risk-reward tradeoffs in mind. In Angie Barksdale’s Michigan home,
                    it’s the three kids without a school to go to.

                <p class="txt-content">Across America there’s a heated discussion underway about when and how to restart
                    an economy that was
                    put on hold to contain the Covid-19 virus. But the often partisan debate can ignore, or reduce to
                    caricature, what’s become a complicated calculus for millions of Americans suddenly thrown out of
                    their jobs.
                </p>
                <p class="txt-content">It involves life and death, economics and family and has left many reluctant to
                    return to work for
                    the time being. It also points to the challenges now facing America’s policymakers and the sometimes
                    clashing incentives government’s response to the crisis has created.
                </p>
                <p class="txt-content">“I love what I do and I would do anything to be back in my salon,” says the
                    22-year-old Crutchfield,
                    who was laid off four weeks ago and has yet to receive an unemployment check in her home state of
                    Georgia, where Republican Governor Brian Kemp has been pushing for an aggressive reopening. “But I
                    don’t feel safe as of right now,” Crutchfield says. “I don’t see how I can touch people all day long
                    and stay safe.”
                </p>
                <p class="txt-content">There’s a financial dimension too. The re-opened salon will likely be booking
                    fewer clients to keep
                    everyone at a distance and safe, so Crutchfield will earn less than both the $700 per week she took
                    home before the crisis or the almost $1,000 a week ($365 from Georgia and $600 from the federal
                    government) she is due in unemployment benefits.</p>
