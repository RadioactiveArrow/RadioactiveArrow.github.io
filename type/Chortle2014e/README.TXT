There are two font families here:

* Matthew Carter's Bitstream Charter (called Chortle2014e here)

* Paul Hunt's Source Sans Pro (Called UserAlt here)

Both fonts are open source fonts and are used in compliance with their
licenses.  Read below for legal details.

---

The fonts were edited using Fontforge, a free open-source font editor:

	http://fontforge.org/

TTF hinting was provided by ttfautohint 

	http://www.freetype.org/ttfautohint/

TTF -> WOFF conversion was done with sfnt2woff:

	http://samiam.org/fonts/code/woff-code.tar.bz2

TTF -> EOT conversion (for IE 6-8) was done with this web service:

	https://www.kirsle.net/wizards/ttf2eot.cgi

Notes on this Bitstream Charter variant

* Hinting provided by ttfautohint.  Bitstream Charter is finally a usable 
  screen font, both in Windows and on a Mac.

* TTF conversion done by Matthew Butterick.  Check out his beautiful Equity
  font:

	http://practicaltypography.com/equity.html

* Underline put closer to the font baseline. 

I have subsetted this font to make it as small as possible; only English
and Spanish are supported by this font.

I have also modified the E and F in the non-italic font to have smaller
serifs so it looks better as a screen font.

The original Bitstream Charter fonts, as donated to the MIT X Consortium
(now X.org), are available here:

My variant of Bitstream Charter, with modified "E" and "F" letters,
as well as the subsetted Source Sans Pro variant used on my webpage:

Charter is the font used for serif text.

Notes on UserAlt 

UserAlt is a derivative of Source Sans Pro which, since modified,
has had its name change.  The following changes have been made:

1) Subsetting.  Only English and Spanish are supported.

2) No open type (Open type renders poorly in Windows, even Windows 7); only
   true type .ttf files used.

3) Different forms (included with Source Sans) for "g" and "l" to look 
   a little more conservative.

4) Fonts rehinted with ttfautohint.

5) Tighter line spacing.

This is the font used for sans serif text.

The original Source Sans Pro is available here:

http://sourceforge.net/projects/sourcesans.adobe/files/

http://samiam.org/fonts/best-opensource/Source-Sans-Pro/

Source Sans Pro was designed by Paul Hunt for Adobe.
